            <p><strong>&ldquo;Can I send you my own materials to lower the cost of my commission?&rdquo;</strong></p>
            <p>When it comes to furs and fabric I typically <em>do not </em>accept them for projects. Some reasons I have include my own allergies, the potential to run out of a color needed, etc. However, I will happily accept pre-bought headbases that are resin, foam cast, or 3D printed. Moving, 3D printed headbases must come hinged or include the equipment to be hinged for that specific base as I no longer will hinge bases myself.&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>&ldquo;Do you do convention pickups for fursuits?&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>Yes! I may offer convention pickups for conventions that I already plan on attending, but I will not go out of my way. I also attend Furnal Equinox in Canada&nbsp;</p>
            <p>for pickup for Canadian clients.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>&ldquo;Something came up, and I&rsquo;m worried about payment. What should I do?&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>If, for any reason, a financial emergency comes up, talk to me. I will do my best to accommodate and work with you to find the best solution. Please keep in mind though the general rule of thumb is that late payments are subject to fees up to 2% per month and will halt any further progress on work.&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>&ldquo;What is an artistic liberty fursuit?&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>An artistic liberty fursuit is where I will design your fursuit for you based on color palettes, moodboards or even just species/colors you would like me to avoid. You can also let me know your budget so I can create a design that you can afford! Keep in mind however that I will not go below my Standard prices. You can apply for an artistic liberty fursuit in my Commission Forms</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>&ldquo;Where do you source your materials?&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>All of my projects are made with fabric from Big Z and/or Howl Fabrics.&nbsp;</p>
