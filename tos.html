            <p class="first-line">By commissioning/ contacting me, you understand the following:&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>I reserve the right to decline or cancel any commission at my own discretion</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Eligibility &amp; Age</strong>: You must be within the United States and 18+ to commission me and be willing to show proof of age.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Allergy Warnings</strong>: I own cats that are fed anti-allergen food. If you have a mild cat allergy (like me) you shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry. However, <em>if you have severe cat allergies you may be affected. </em>If in doubt, I don&rsquo;t recommend commissioning me.</p>
            <p><strong>Privacy Notice: </strong>Clients have the right to privacy for all personal information exchanged in the commission process.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="section-head"><strong>Payment:&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Deposit</strong>: A deposit of 30% of your quoted price is required to secure a commission slot and is non-refundable to cover materials.</p>
            <p><strong>Payment Plans</strong>: Clients have the option to pay in full, a 4 month payment plan or an 8 month payment plan, depending on project size. The deposit will count as the first payment and the remaining payments must be made every 30 days via PayPal invoicing. Clients will be charged 2% of each monthly payment toward the PayPal transaction fee.</p>
            <p><strong>Late Payments</strong>: Late payments are subject to fees up to 2% per month and will halt any further progress on work. Commission must be fully paid before receiving finished work. Clients should communicate with me if for any circumstances that may interfere with paying on time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Payment Methods</strong>: PayPal invoicing in USD</p>
            <p><strong>Shipping</strong>: Client is responsible for paying for shipping, insurance, and customs fees.</p>
            <p><br /><br /></p>
            <p><strong>Refunds &amp; Cancellations: </strong>The 30% deposit is<strong> non-refundable</strong>. If I decide that I am unable to complete the project due to my own circumstances, the product will be shipped as is and a refund is given according to the amount of work that was not completed, minus shipping costs. If I decide to cancel due to violation of my TOS, the client may receive a <strong>partial </strong>refund.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If work hasn't started and a client wishes to cancel then a partial refund may also be available. If the client cancels in the middle of the project then any payment already made is <strong>forfeit and nonrefundable</strong>. Clients are required to fully pay the amount due for any work already completed or any work that is more than half way completed.</p>
            <p><br /><br /></p>
            <p class="section-head"><strong>Process &amp; Communication:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Commission Contract: </strong>Clients must sign a contract regarding the terms of commissioning me. An example of this paperwork is available upon request.</p>
            <p><strong>Work Schedule: </strong>I do not do strict deadlines and rush fees are <strong>NOT </strong>available. There are often delays with shipping and materials that are out of my control. However, I will do my best to work within the payment plan period.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Updates:</strong> My primary communication is through Telegram and my Telegram channel where I post weekly updates with progress photos. Clients are free to contact me through any of my socials but will be redirected to my Telegram channel</p>
            <p><strong>Design: </strong>Clear reference art will be required. <strong>AI generated images, art, or stolen art are not allowed</strong> and in some circumstances may result in blacklist. Artistic liberty options are available.</p>
            <p><strong>Changes: </strong>General changes after work has already been started may be subjected to additional charges on a time and materials basis, at my standard hourly rate of $17. Substantive changes that amount to 30% of the time or materials will require the commission to be repriced and paperwork re-signed to reflect said changes.</p>
            <p><strong>Warranty/Repairs</strong>: Work may be sent back to me for repairs from <em>normal wear and tear. </em>I will not do repairs on work with proof of mold, 18+ activity, foul smells, unwashed stains, personal alternations, or other miscellaneous reasons that deem the fursuit unrepairable.</p>
            <p class="section-head"><strong>Usage Rights:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Artist Rights:</strong> I reserve the right to use images of finished work to advertise for my brand.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Use:</strong> Clients can use the suit freely, though tagging is always appreciated</p>
            <p><strong>Commercial Use: </strong>Tagging is requested. I ask that for adult content/after-dark use, you do not include the Khal Critical brand.</p>
            <p><br /><br /></p>
            <p><strong>What I Won't Do</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>No hateful, racist, transphobic designs</li>
                <li>Work with clients who are rude, hateful, support white supremacy, Nazism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, zoophilia, or pedophilia.</li>
                <li>Work with minors, regardless of parent/guardian permission.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>No NSFW (murrsuits)</li>
                <li>No copyrighted characters (Pokemon, etc.).</li>
                <li>No copies of someone else&rsquo;s design or style</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br /><br /></p>
            <p><strong>Blacklisting:</strong></p>
            <p>I have NO TOLERANCE for harassment and discrimination and I WILL cancel the commission if I find the client is responsible for such behavior. Reasons for blacklisting may include one or more of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using stolen art or designs for your fursuit reference</li>
                <li>Lying about your age in order to commission me</li>
                <li>Attempting to send back commissions with mold, used for 18+ activities, or the potential for anything else that poses a biohazard risk for me.</li>
                <li>Sharing my personal information&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Going over 3 months without contacting me while actively working on commission</li>
            </ul>
